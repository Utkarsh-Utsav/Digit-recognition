# Digit-recognition
Digit recognition - Octave - Neural networks

Training parameters for predicting single digit from the image ie finding theta.
To use any jpeg/png image we will convert it into gray-scale image 20*20 using imageTOGray20x20 first.
Then we will used the computed theta for prediction
